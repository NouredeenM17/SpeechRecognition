This is a python calculator with speech recognition and text-to-speech. 
It can make basic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
It can also make interest calculations.
Results are displayed in the GUI and told out loud with text-to-speech.
This calculator uses an offline speech recognition model called VOSK Offline Speech Recognition. 

This was created in "Python" class in the second semester of my second year in Computer Engineering.
